2CGmodel
========

2CG stands for 2 Compartment Granule Cell.

The original code from Licurgo de Almeida et al (2013) was edited such that the single compartment granule cells were upgraded to a 2 compartment model with distal dendritic and somatic compartments.

The original code also included OSN, glomerular, periglomerular, mitral, pyramidal, feedforward inhibitory, and feedback inhibitory neurons, but I only need the mitral cells for my current purposes. The original code also initializes variables through a text file, but I want to do it through a PSQL-based database. This repository will keep track of the changes I make as I strip down and modify the code in case I want to go back.
